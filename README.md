```

## 🔑 API Configuration

### Gemini AI (Required for AI-powered results)
1. Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Add to `server/.env`: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### Imagen 3 (Optional - for AI-generated images)
1. Set up Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled
